# Description of the Project:
An application to leave reviews about services offered by  various businesses, like restaurants and shops. In this application, upon posting a review, the reviewer will be awarded native tokens as incentives. Users can also upvote or 
downvote reviews and earn tokens.  

# Problem specification related to ERC 1973:
Most of the times, consumers leave a review about any service the receive when they are not satisfied,or extremely satisfied;  and if they are, there is no reward for spending time to leave a review. Consumers usually look at the overall ratings and don't spend much time to read the reviews, comment or "like" or "dislike" them. 

# Solution in relation to ERC 1973:
This application rewards reviewers with tokens, which can be redeemed in the same service provider or other ones. "like"s or "dislike"s of reviews will be awarded too.
Everyday, a specific number of tokens will be minted and added to the " token Pool". Once a review posted, reviewer will earn some token from the pool. The amount of that depends of the amount of credit or RevPower of that reviewer. Posting more reviews, commenting or voting on increases the RevPower but Revpower can be decreases by downvotes.
There is a grace period after posting a review for businesses to comment on it. During this period, it is not possible to vote or comment on that review. After that, any user who vote or comment earlier, earn more tokens. This encourages users to act on a review as soon as possible.
These tokens can be exchanged to "Pearl", an ERC20 token. They also be used upon future purchases in participating businesses.
