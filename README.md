# Description of the Project:
This is an decentralized application based on Ethereum blockchain to leave reviews about services offered by  various businesses, like restaurants, shops or even airlines. In this application, upon posting a review, the reviewer will be rewarded by a digital tokens called "Pearl" as incentives. Users can also upvote, downvote or comment on  reviews and get rewarded as well.  
Most of the times, consumers leave a review about any service the receive when they are not satisfied,or extremely satisfied;  and if they are, there is no reward for spending time to leave a review. Consumers usually look at the overall ratings and don't spend much time to read the reviews, comment or "like" or "dislike" them.
Everyday, a specific number of Pearls will be minted and added to the " token Pool". Once a review posted, reviewer will earn some token from the pool. The amount of that depends of the amount of RevPower of that reviewer. Posting more reviews, commenting or voting on increases the RevPower but Revpower can be decreases by downvotes.
There is a grace period after posting a review for businesses to comment on it. During this period, it is not possible to vote or comment on that review. After that, any user who vote or comment earlier, earn more tokens. This encourages users to act on a review as soon as possible.

# Who can post reviews?
Anybody after opening an account can post reviews and any review can be rewarded by Pearl.

# What is Pearl?
Pearl is a digital token, based on EIP 1973 standard. Everyday, an specific number of Pearls will be minted and added to the "Reward Pool". Pearls from this pool will be distributed amongst posts, based on reviewrs Revpower, Fama, Fort and the number of downvotes or upvotes and reputation of voters.
Pearls can be used in participating businesses toward future purchases. It can be transferred to other users as well. The value of that depend of the market at any given time.

# Now, what is Revpower?
Revpower is the unit of influence in Perligo. All users start with a small amount of Revpower upon opening an account but they can increase it by exchanging Pearl for Revpower. Users with higher Revpowers earn more by posting reviews or voting.
Revpower can be lent to other users, but those users cannot convert it to Pearl.

# ...and What is Fama?
Fama is the measure of reputation in Perligo. Every user has a Fama guage, much like life guage in video games. Upvotes on one's post increases the Fama but downvotes do the apposite. Only downvotes of users with higher Fama has negative effect.
People often read reviews of or follow  reviewers with higher Fama because they know they are spending their time on good quality content.
Difference between Fama and Revpower? Revpower is buyable, but Fama is not.

# What happens when a new review is posted?
There is a grace period for reviewed business to comment on this new review. During this time, it is not possible to vote or comment. After that, any users who vote or comment earlier, gets rewarded more.
Downvotes do not get rewarded since it has negative effect on the reward for that review.

# What if some abusers keep voting or commenting in a meaningless manner to earn rewards?
Here comes Voting Fort. It is like fuel for voting engine.Every vote burns some of this fuel and users have limited amount of Fort each day. Lower Fort also has negative effect of users influence.This makes sure users use their voting power wisely.
Voting Fort replenishes every day.

# Now after all of this, how much do I earn from my review?
This greatly depend on your Revpower, Fort and Fama. Also it depends on number of upvotes and comments you get and from who you get them. Overall activity in the community  has a significant affect on your reward too since you get your reward from the reward pool.
